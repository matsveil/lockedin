## Why?
I've tried out pretty much every meditation app out there, but I could never stick with any of them for more than a few weeks. I just wanted something dead simple and easy on the eyes, you know? So, I went ahead and created MindfulPause. It's my first crack at making an app, and I'll admit, it's not perfect, but hey, it might just be what you need to bring more mindfulness into your life :)

MindfulPause is all about keeping it simple. I made sure it's user-friendly and looks good, so it's easier for you to get into the mindfulness groove. And yeah, I know, it's not flawless, but I genuinely think it can help you be more mindful in your day-to-day.

I'm really grateful for your support, and I hope MindfulPause can be a valuable addition to your mindfulness journey. If you give it a shot and have any thoughts or suggestions to make it better, please don't hold back! Your feedback means a lot as I keep tweaking and improving the app.
